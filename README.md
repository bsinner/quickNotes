# Quick Notes Enterprise Java Spring 2019 Project

Enterprise Java Spring 2019 Individual Project

### Problem Statement
When people take notes they often use word processors or a 
pen and paper. Although these methods work, they have
drawbacks. Programs need to be downloaded, require users to 
remember they saved their notes, and sometimes have more 
features than are needed for simply taking notes. Although 
notebooks and sticky notes are simple, they can be lost or 
misplaced and they are bad for the environment.

In this project I would like to make a website that combines 
the simplicity of pens and paper and the eco-friendliness of
taking notes on a computer.
