# Blake Sinner Individual Project

### Problem Statement
When users make notes they often use word processors or a notebooks/sticky notes. Although these 
two methods work for some, they have their drawbacks. Word processors need to be installed, require 
users to remember where their files are saved, and sometimes have learning curves. Pen and paper 
mediums on the other hand can be lost and lack the functionality of word processors. 

With this project I would like to solve the problems of desktop word processors by making a website 
that's simple and easy to use, and that allows users to save their files to one common location. 
I also think that this website will be an improvement over notebooks and sticky notes because it will 
have basic formatting features, such as changing font color and size, and because it will allow users
to save their notes.
