# Blake Sinner Individual Project

### Problem Statement
When users make notes they often use word processors or a 
notebook/sticky notes. Although these methods work, they have their
drawbacks. Word processors need to be downloaded, require users to 
remember where their files are saved, and sometimes have learning 
curves. Notebooks and sticky notes on the other hand can be lost and 
don't have the functionality of word processors. 

With this project I would like to solve the problems of desktop word
processors by making a website that's simple and easy to use, and that 
allows users to save their files to a common location. I also think that
this website will be an improvement over notebooks and sticky notes 
because it will have formatting features, such as changing font size and
embeding links, and because it will allow users to save their notes.
